# Vital-Monitor-System
## CO327: Operating Systems Project
###  In a hospital, there will be a number of patients whose vitals (things like heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) should be monitored. Each patient would be connected to a vital monitor and these monitors willbtransmit the vital information over a network to a central location. That way nursing staff will be able to monitor many patients and do it remotely â€“ which is useful when the patients are contagious.
